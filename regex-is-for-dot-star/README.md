# Regex is for .*
This is another instance of an introductory Regular Expressions talk given by Jean Lange. You can find a [recording of a past version](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1087718582) on Academy Pittsburgh's Twitch channel.

## Session description:
Regular expressions are a powerful tool available to coders in many programming languages - but they’re so cryptic and hard to read/work with! Let’s explore what they can do for you and where you might want to use them. Then we’ll dive into regex101.com and the regex crossword for practical examples of how to use, test, and learn more about regular expressions.
